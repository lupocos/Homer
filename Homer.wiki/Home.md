# Welcome to the Homer wiki! #

Homer is a package of hardware and software that provides an inexpensive and efficient solution to scan books. 

(Watch the video ["Homer, a nod to the Gutenberg press"][5] from [Sojournposse][6] on [Vimeo][7])

The "prototype" is based on a [previous model][1] developed by [Daniel Reetz][3] and [Matti Kariluoma][4]. Dan is also the founder of an online community of hackers sharing their knowledge and passion for [do-it-yourself book scanning][2], which is where we drew most of our original inspiration.

On this wiki you will find information on how to use Homer, as well as how to contribute to it.
